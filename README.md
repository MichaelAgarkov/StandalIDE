# StandalIDE
A **free**, **open-source** and **easy to use** IDE made on PascalABC.NET

Mostly all the stuff were scratched from my old closed project called MicWord, for me to make an IDE for you, and for it to be open-source!

StandalIDE stands for Standalone IDE, because I am planning to make it to be not like any other IDE, I want it to be for any programming language, and for it to be available to everyone for free!

It's size is also lesser than 1 MB, so it's very compact, just for you to save space on your small laptop ;)

It's distributed with the BSD 4-Clause License, so you have the freedom to release your own versions with your own modifications, for you to feel the full freedom while using it! (Just follow the EULA and don't break it)

For the source code, I recommend using PascalABC.NET version 3.4.2 build 2050, because it's the version I use, and the version it is compiled in. You can get it here: https://tinyurl.com/PascalABCNET

For the installer, I recommend using Inno Setup 6.0.5, because it's the version I use, and the version it is compiled in. You can get it here: https://tinyurl.com/InnoSetup605
